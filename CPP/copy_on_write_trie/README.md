# Copy-on-Write Trie

Copy-on-write trie is a data structure that can be used to implement dictionary, set, map, and other data structures. It uses the concepts of shared structure and delayed copying to reduce memory usage and copying overhead.

## Features

- High-performance implementation of copy-on-write trie
- Support for dictionary, set, map, and other data structures
- Efficient insertion, lookup, and deletion operations
- Thread-safe implementation with support for concurrent access and modification
